# Presentations
This repository contains slides for presentations I have given, including:

- ***'Quantitative modelling of the energy cost of Na+ exclusion, transport and storage in plant roots under salt stress.'*** I gave this presentation as an Invited Speaker at the 22nd *New Phytologist* Workshop on the energy costs of salinity at the University of Adelaide in 2018.

- ***â€˜Mathematically modelling the salt stress response of individual plant cells.'*** I presented this talk at the 59th Annual Meeting of the Australian Mathematical Society at Flinders University in 2015.

- ***'Whole-of-plant study of water and salt transport: A mathematical modelling approach.'*** I gave this five minute presentation on my research and the benefits of the Industry Doctoral Training Centre (IDTC) PhD program to an audience of 20 research leaders from diverse disciplines (including the DVC:Research & Innovation) at the University of Adelaide in 2015.
